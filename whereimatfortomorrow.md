# Current Status and Next Steps for Deployment

## Current Status

### 1. **Front Door Configuration**
- **Issue**: Front Door is not fully functional due to SSL certificate mismatch and potential misconfiguration of health probes and routing.
- **What We've Done**:
  - Created the Front Door profile (`pippaioflondoncdx2-afd`) and endpoint (`chat-ep`).
  - Configured origin group (`og-app`) and origin (`chat-origin`) with health probe settings.
  - Added diagnostic settings for Front Door.
- **Pending**:
  - Fix SSL certificate mismatch for the Front Door endpoint.
  - Verify and update health probe paths and routing rules.
  - Manually configure WAF policy in the Azure Portal.

### 2. **Database Configuration**
- **Issue**: The database type and configuration need review to ensure compatibility and performance.
- **What We've Done**:
  - Created a Cosmos DB account (`pippaioflondoncdx2-cosmos`) with serverless mode.
  - Created a database (`chatdb`) and container (`chats`) with partition key `/sessionId`.
  - Enabled continuous backup for Cosmos DB.
- **Pending**:
  - Verify if Cosmos DB is the optimal choice for the application.
  - Ensure analytical storage is enabled for the container.

### 3. **App Service Configuration**
- **Issue**: App Service settings need verification, and staging slot configuration is incomplete.
- **What We've Done**:
  - Created an App Service Plan (`pippaioflondoncdx2-plan`) with Linux OS.
  - Deployed the App Service (`pippaioflondoncdx2-app`) with Node.js runtime.
  - Assigned a managed identity to the App Service.
  - Configured app settings to use Key Vault references for secrets.
- **Pending**:
  - Verify that the App Service is fully functional.
  - Complete staging slot configuration and run smoke tests.

### 4. **AI Services**
- **Issue**: OpenAI model deployments need verification.
- **What We've Done**:
  - Deployed GPT-4o and DALLE-3 models using Azure CLI.
  - Stored API keys in Key Vault for secure reference.
- **Pending**:
  - Verify that the models are deployed and accessible.

### 5. **Tag Policy and Resource Protection**
- **Issue**: Tag policy and resource protection need validation.
- **What We've Done**:
  - Created and assigned a tag policy to enforce `environment` and `owner` tags.
  - Added a resource lock to prevent accidental deletion of the resource group.
- **Pending**:
  - Validate that all resources comply with the tag policy.

### 6. **Verification and Diagnostics**
- **Issue**: Deployment verification is incomplete.
- **What We've Done**:
  - Added diagnostic settings for Key Vault, Cosmos DB, and Front Door.
  - Created a troubleshooting script for Front Door issues.
- **Pending**:
  - Run deployment verification scripts.
  - Analyze diagnostic logs for errors or warnings.

## Steps Before Deployment

### 1. **Fix Front Door Issues**
- Update health probe paths to match the App Service configuration.
- Fix SSL certificate mismatch by associating a valid certificate with the Front Door endpoint.
- Verify routing rules and ensure traffic is correctly forwarded to the App Service.
- Manually configure and associate the WAF policy in the Azure Portal.

### 2. **Review Database Configuration**
- Confirm that Cosmos DB is the best choice for the application.
- Enable analytical storage for the `chats` container if required.

### 3. **Complete App Service Configuration**
- Verify that the App Service is running and accessible.
- Complete staging slot configuration and run smoke tests.
- Swap the staging slot with production after successful tests.

### 4. **Verify AI Services**
- Check that GPT-4o and DALLE-3 models are deployed and accessible.
- Test API integrations with the application.

### 5. **Validate Tag Policy and Resource Protection**
- Ensure all resources have the required `environment` and `owner` tags.
- Confirm that the resource lock is applied to the resource group.

### 6. **Run Deployment Verification**
- Execute the deployment verification script to test all major components:
  - Front Door connectivity
  - App Service accessibility
  - Key Vault secrets
  - OpenAI model deployments
- Analyze diagnostic logs for any issues.

## Summary

We have made significant progress in setting up the infrastructure and deploying key components. However, several critical tasks remain before we can consider the deployment complete. Addressing the Front Door issues, reviewing the database configuration, and completing the App Service setup are top priorities. Once these tasks are resolved, we can proceed with final verification and deployment.
